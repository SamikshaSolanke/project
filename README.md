# ðŸ§  My first End-to-End Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my **Student Score Predictor** project. 
This project walks through the entire Data Science lifecycleâ€”from raw data to deploymentâ€”highlighting essential steps like EDA, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

ðŸš€ **Live Deployment**: Hosted on [Render](https://student-score-predictor-4yij.onrender.com/)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a **Supervised Machine Learning Classification Problem** using Python and Scikit-learn. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately predict outcomes based on input features from a structured dataset. It follows the complete data science pipeline including:

- Data Collection and Understanding  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, feature scaling)  
- Model Selection and Training  
- Model Evaluation and Tuning  
- Web Deployment with Flask on Render

This not only demonstrates technical proficiency in machine learning but also project workflow, reproducibility, and real-world deployment of models.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

### 1. **Problem Definition**
   - Understand the dataset and define the objective of prediction.
  
### 2. **Data Collection**
   - Loaded a CSV dataset and performed sanity checks.
  
### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions and correlations
   - Identified outliers and missing values

### 4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Categorical encoding (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
   - Imputed missing values
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

### 5. **Model Building**
   - Trained multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
   - Compared model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Used GridSearchCV to find the optimal model parameters

### 7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the best model on test data
   - Generated classification reports and confusion matrix

### 8. **Deployment**
   - Created a Flask web app
   - Deployed on Render for public use
